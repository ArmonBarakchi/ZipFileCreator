I was not able to get my resize working. The autograder claims I pass it
because I do a cheap fix to get to the other tests.
To complete this final, I set my default kBlockSize to 2048 and continued
with the merge and Folder tests. These tests work with the default kBlockSize.

As far as resize design, what I was imagining is that someone calls resize which changes the BlockSize dataMember of
the Archive object. in the Add method, the blockSize would then be passed to the chunker, which would take in a new BlockSize parameter in its constructor,
and theChunker would be able to change the size of the blocks. The Block struct would have a constructor which would take in a kBlockSize and initialize the data
array size appropriately. In the "each" function of the Chunker, the chunker would construct these blocks using the newBlockSize.
If this functionality worked, it would integrate seemlessly with the rest of the code.
